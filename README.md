# Job-Scam-Detection

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify job postings as real or fake using machine learning techniques. Fake job postings have become a major issue, and this system helps detect fraudulent listings based on key features.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for this project contains job descriptions, company details, and other features.
- Data includes structured information like job titles, locations, salaries, and unstructured text data like descriptions.

## Objectives
- Preprocess the job listing data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends
- Apply feature engineering techniques
- Train and evaluate classification models to distinguish scam jobs
- Deploy the model (if applicable)

## Technologies Used
- Python 
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn 
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models) 
- NLP techniques (if text analysis is used)
- Streamlit/Flask (if deployed as a web app)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing key insights like most common job industries, salary distributions, and fraudulent job characteristics.
- Identifying missing values, correlations, and feature importance.

## Model Training
- Implemented models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost (for better performance)
- Evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Deployment
- If deploying, use **Streamlit** for a simple web UI or **Flask** for API-based deployment.
